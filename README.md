# Dark War - Zeus Wrath
Dark War - Zeus Wrath is a third person shooter game made with UPBGE. Currently, it's not in a playable state, but it will change soon.

Based on an old PC game series ([Dark Wars](https://archive.org/details/dw_3_0) and [Dark War II](https://archive.org/details/dw2_1_3), specifically), the game will bring features not so common on its genre, like:
- Visual map editor.
- An easy custom campaign system based on playing common media files (png, ogg, etc) and map coordinates triggering scripts.
- Easy embbeded script language, made specially for custom campaigns. It will not have more than a dozen of keywords, allowing anyone to learn without previous scripting knowledge.
- Open world support (size is limited to the campaign custom map).
- Auto-updater linked with Github, allowing the player to get the latest minimal changes with no effort, with no bounds to 'releases'.
- Local multiplayer's teamplay or deathmatch games (with support to custom maps as well).

The todo list may (and will) change according to the project advance, and some features may be added or removed.
